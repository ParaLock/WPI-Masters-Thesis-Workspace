* We should demonstrate supporting a gradient of functionality i.e some providers provide opengl accelerated rendering while others do not.
* How do we handle provider dependencies. What if I want LWJGL window but dont care about rest of LWJGL functionality?
* the user should be able to think of window concept in terms of the functionality they desire i.e window resizing, hardware accelerated rendering etc, basic input/output handling, window events?
* When do we need implement lower level concepts?
